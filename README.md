Quiz Web Application
This is a web-based quiz application that allows users to select a programming language (HTML, CSS, or JavaScript) and take a quiz based on their selection. The quiz provides real-time feedback, a timer for each question, and displays the user's score at the end of the quiz. The project is designed to enhance learning and testing knowledge of programming languages.

Features
Language Selection: Users can select from HTML, CSS, or JavaScript to take a quiz based on their chosen language.
Timed Quiz: Each question is time-limited (15 seconds) to encourage quick thinking.
Interactive Feedback: Users receive instant feedback on whether their answer was correct or incorrect.
Score Tracking: The user's score is tracked and displayed at the end of the quiz.
Responsive Design: The quiz is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes.
Replay Option: After finishing the quiz, users can restart the quiz and try again.
Timer & Progress Bar: A countdown timer is displayed for each question, and a progress bar visually represents the time passing.
Technologies Used
HTML: Markup for the structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling for the visual presentation of the quiz.
JavaScript: Handles quiz logic, timer functionality, and dynamic content updates.
FontAwesome: Used for icons to mark correct and incorrect answers.
